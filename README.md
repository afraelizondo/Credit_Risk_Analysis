# Credit Risk Analysis


## Overview of the project

Over the last years, FinTech has been using Machine Learning to perform analysis and get to know predictions about credit risk of their potential users. Machine learning is the use of statistical algorithms to perform tasks such as learning from data patterns and making predictions. 

One of the main reasons to use this powerful tool, is that machine learning provides a quicker and more reliable loan experience; also, the election of candidates for the credit loans, can be more accurate. To choose which model is the adequate, many evaluations have to be performed, in order to select the one that fits better with the specific data. 

In this specific project, we were working with a real-world challenge: credit card risk; this with the help of a dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company. This kind of risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans.
